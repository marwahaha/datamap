To build yourself, clone repository and type ```jekyll serve```.

To add to the list of support resources and projects, you can update the CSVs in _data. There are a couple Python scripts (```csv_to_jekyll_projects.py```, ```csv_to_jekyll_support.py```) to run that will regenerate all files. (run them before ```jekyll serve```)

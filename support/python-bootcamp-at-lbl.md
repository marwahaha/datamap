description: The purpose of the boot camp is to get those familiar with other computing languages (like C, Java, FORTRAN, and Lisp) ramped on the basics of the Python language. This is not a computer science class; understanding of basic CS concepts (like looping, recursion, pointers, etc.) are presupposed. The boot camp itself is a mixture of formal lectures, in-class demos, coding breakout sessions for participants, and homework projects. The Camp runs from 8:30am to 5pm each day and is open to anyone within the UC Berkeley and LBNL community.  A small fee to offset the costs will be collected at the time of official registration. There will be a limited number of slots open to industry participants.

description: The Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF) at UC Berkeley's College of Natural Resources provides leadership and training across a broad array of integrated mapping technologies. Our goal is to help people better understand the changing world through the analysis and visualization of spatial data. We develop engaging applications that leverage and build upon state-of-the-art geospatial and web technologies, and provide opportunities for researchers to learn how they can use spatial data to answer critical questions. GIF workshops offer hands-on applications oriented training in a variety of geospatial topics. Workshop fees are available FREE of charge for all UC students (graduate and undergraduate), faculty, and staff. Workshop fees are $224 for all non-UC affiliates.

description: The Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS) was established in 2012 to strengthen the quality of social science research and evidence used for policy-making. The initiative aims to enhance the practices of economists, psychologists, political scientists, and other social scientists in ways that promote research transparency, reproducibility, and openness. BITSS is spearheaded by a distinguished, interdisciplinary group of faculty members across 10 academic institutions that provide thought leadership for the “open social science” movement. Under their guidance, the initiative is generating high quality research through a strong network that uses and generates a library of educational materials.

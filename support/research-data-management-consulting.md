description: UC Berkeley's Research Data Management program is a collaborative campus-wide initiative led jointly by Research IT and the Library to help researchers manage their research data. With our partner network across campus, we offer a discipline-agnostic service that supports researchers as they find, generate, store, share, and archive their data. Contact RDM Consulting (researchdata@berkeley.edu) if you would like to arrange a group class tailored to your department’s or group’s data management needs.

description: The Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF) at UC Berkeley's College of Natural Resources provides leadership and training across a broad array of integrated mapping technologies. Our goal is to help people better understand the changing world through the analysis and visualization of spatial data. We develop engaging applications that leverage and build upon state-of-the-art geospatial and web technologies, and provide opportunities for researchers to learn how they can use spatial data to answer critical questions. GIF Staff are available for advice and assistance on geospatial projects throughout the week. Note that we each have different areas of expertise! There is also more involved consulting at http://gif.berkeley.edu/support/consulting.html

D-Lab Consulting,D-Lab Consulting,Graduate,Social Science,1 on 1 Consulting,http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting,"D-Lab offers consulting services on research design, data analysis, data management, and related techniques and technologies. We welcome inquiries from Berkeley faculty, staff, postdocs, and grad students at all levels of expertise. Our standard consulting services are free of charge."
D-Lab Trainings,D-Lab Trainings,Graduate,Social Science,Workshops,http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training,"D-Lab helps Berkeley faculty, staff, and graduate students move forward with world-class research in data intensive social science. We think of data as an expansive category, one that is constantly changing as the research frontier moves. We offer a venue for methodological exchange from all corners of campus and across its bounds."
D-Lab Working Groups,D-Lab Working Groups,Graduate,Social Science,Weekly Meetings,http://dlab.berkeley.edu/working-groups,"D-Lab working groups bring together researchers from across disciplines and departments who share a common interest under the broad rubric of data-intensive social science. These self-organizing groups meet regularly to discuss relevant research, master a new technological skill, or collaborate on a project."
BIDS Fellows Office Hours,BIDS Fellows Office Hours,Graduate,Numerical,1 on 1 Consulting,http://bids.berkeley.edu/resources/office-hours,"BIDS fellows are available throughout the week for office hours to discuss data-intensive research. We would like to learn more about the data science problems you encounter, and we will do our best to steer you toward resources that can help you learn how best to approach them."
The Hacker Within,The Hacker Within,Graduate,Numerical,Weekly Meetings,http://www.thehackerwithin.org/berkeley/,"This is a weekly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for scientific computation. In these friendly sessions, peers at all levels of experience share topics useful in our scientific software development workflows. This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, showing off useful features of a scientific library or programming language you're using, or bringing up a computational problem you're having."
Data Lab,Data Lab,Undergraduate,Numerical,1 on 1 Consulting,http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/libraries/data-lab,"The Data Lab offers consultations on research involving numeric data, including finding and recommending data sources and advising on technical data issues such as file format conversion, web scraping, and basic statistical software use. The Lab also provides workstations with analytical software such as ArcGIS, Stata, SAS, SPSS, Stata, R, and Python."
Software Carpentry Workshops at BIDS,Software Carpentry Workshops at BIDS,Graduate,Numerical,Workshops,http://bids.berkeley.edu/research/software-carpentry,Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization whose goal is to make scientists more productive and their work more reliable by teaching them basic computing skills.
Hackers at Berkeley Workshops,Hackers at Berkeley Workshops,Undergraduate,Numerical,Workshops,http://hackersatberkeley.com/,"Hackers @ Berkeley holds frequent workshops, hackerspaces, and social events. We're a community driven by sharing knowledge, building projects, and helping each other become better hackers. All workshops are run by volunteers. If you have something cool to share with the Hack community, email workshops@hackersatberkeley.com to set up an event."

Machine Learning at Berkeley (Workshops),Machine Learning at Berkeley (Workshops),Undergraduate,Numerical,Workshops,http://ml.berkeley.edu/,ML@B works with clients on challenging problems related to Machine Learning and Data Science. We conduct internal research projects on a variety of topics.
Data Science Society at Berkeley (Tutoring),Data Science Society at Berkeley (Tutoring),Undergraduate,Numerical,Workshops,http://dssberkeley.org/,"Founded in early 2016, Data Science Society at Berkeley (DSSB) is the first and only undergraduate data science group at UC Berkeley. Our mission is to foster a community of data science interests at UC Berkelely, where students meet and connect.We provide valuable learning and networking opportunities for our members through a wide range of events and extensive collaboration with other communities in US universities and Silicon Valley companies."
HKN Tutoring,HKN Tutoring,Undergraduate,Numerical,1 on 1 Consulting,https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/tutor,"Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) is the national Electrical and Computer Engineering honor society. The Berkeley chapter is among the most active engineering societies at Berkeley, providing academic services to fellow undergraduates. Our two offices are located in 290 Cory and 345 Soda near the northeastern corner of the UC Berkeley campus."
Python Bootcamp at LBL,Python Bootcamp at LBL,Graduate,Numerical,Workshops,https://sites.google.com/site/pythonbootcamp/,"The purpose of the boot camp is to get those familiar with other computing languages (like C, Java, FORTRAN, and Lisp) ramped on the basics of the Python language. This is not a computer science class; understanding of basic CS concepts (like looping, recursion, pointers, etc.) are presupposed. The boot camp itself is a mixture of formal lectures, in-class demos, coding breakout sessions for participants, and homework projects. The Camp runs from 8:30am to 5pm each day and is open to anyone within the UC Berkeley and LBNL community.  A small fee to offset the costs will be collected at the time of official registration. There will be a limited number of slots open to industry participants. "

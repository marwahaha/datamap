BIDS Collaborative Projects,BIDS Collaborative Projects,Undergraduate,Industry,http://datasci.berkeley.edu,"Graduate and undergraduate students experience a great disconnect between academic work and real-world impact. Much of their skills and experience are not applied to real-world problems during their time in Berkeley. At the same time, many organizations on and off campus have limited bandwidth to solve their complex data science challenges. BIDS Collaborative will solve this disconnect between student demand for projects with real-world impact and institutions that lack the resources to recruit data scientists. \n\n BIDS Collaborative will facilitate the creation of four-student interdisciplinary teams to work on semester- and year-long real-world projects. Working with faculty, we will also provide students with academic credit and training opportunities. BIDS Collaborative hopes to develop innovative data science solutions to challenges in academia, government, non-profits, and industry while also creating a pipeline of students for successful future careers in data science.

Machine Learning at Berkeley Industry Projects,Machine Learning at Berkeley Industry Projects (ML@B|C),Undergraduate,Industry,http://ml.berkeley.edu,"ML@B aims to empower passionate students to solve real world data-driven  problems through collaboration with companies and internal research. \n\n ML@B will be hosting public events throughout the semester including tech talks, guest lectures, workshops, and research mixers. They are also launching two pilot programs --- research division, ML@B|X and our consulting operations, ML@B|C. Selected students will be paired with teams where they can work on projects ranging from predicting consumer trends to building computing clusters."

Digital Humanities at Berkeley Projects,Digital Humanities at Berkeley Projects,Graduate,Research,http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/projects,"The DH project directory is a listing of digital humanities work at Berkeley. Project pages are good for raising the visibility of your work and connecting to collaborators, both on- and off-campus. Anyone with a UC Berkeley affiliation can submit a project. After submitting an initial (brief) application for a project page, project owners will be able to edit and update their project information via the DH at Berkeley at website. Projects that are complete or are no longer affiliated with UC Berkeley will be archived at the end of each semester."
Undergraduate Statistics Association Research Projects,Undergraduate Statistics Association Research Projects,Undergraduate,Research,http://www.usaberkeley.org/#!project/vhvnv,"The Undergraduate Statistics Association is a premier organization at UC Berkeley that stimulates its members' interests in Statistics and facilitates their further development in a statistics career. Each semester we work on a diverse slate of projects. From analyzing city traffic data to surveying Cal Undergraduates, our members become experienced data collectors, data mungers, data modelers, data visualizers, and data presenters. We bring skill sets from academia and the workforce to tackle any kind of challenge. More importantly, we come together as a team to learn from each other and collaborate together."

BERC Innovative Solutions,BERC Innovative Solutions (BIS),Graduate,Industry,http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/berc-innovative-solutions/,"BERC Innovative Solutions (BIS) is an energy and resources-focused consulting program led by students from across UC Berkeley’s top graduate departments. The program’s evolution has been driven by demand from both students and organizations in business, nonprofit and government. BIS is dedicated to working with clients to address their strategic energy and resources opportunities and challenges, while providing talented students with experiential learning through meaningful projects. The BIS application process matches balanced teams with complementary areas of academic focus and past professional experience with the skill sets needed to meet each client’s needs. Collaborating across academic disciplines provides both unique opportunities for student participants and rich perspectives for BIS clients."

All of our projects aim to make either a social or environmental impact, regardless of whether we work with a nonprofit or a Fortune 500 company."
CDIPS Data Science Workshop,CDIPS Data Science Workshop,Graduate,Industry,http://cdips.physics.berkeley.edu/2016-cdips-data-science-workshop/,"CDIPS is a graduate student run organization that provides resources to graduate students and postdocs in the physical and mathematical sciences about their options outside academia through a speaker series, the Data Science Workshop, and improved access to alumni.  Founded in 2012, CDIPS aims to provide scientists with the information they need to make better informed career decisions. The Data Science Workshop is a three-week program in late July where small teams of graduate students are paired with mentors from industry to complete an outstanding problem in data science. It was developed to address an issue that was highlighted by a number of our guests from the Speaker Series--- The gap between academic science and industry is often narrow but deep. Many of the skills you may lack are seen as necessary by an employer, but can be easily learned."

SDAV Projects,SDAV Projects,Graduate,Development,http://www.sdav-scidac.org/,"The SciDAC SDAV Institute will actively work with application teams to assist them in achieving breakthrough science and will provide technical solutions in the data management, analysis, and visualization regimes that are broadly applicable in the computational science community. As the scale of computation has exploded, the data produced by these simulations has increased in size, complexity, and richness by orders of magnitude, and this trend will continue. Users of scientific computing systems are faced with the daunting task of managing and analyzing their datasets for knowledge discovery, frequently using antiquated tools more appropriate for the teraflop era. While new techniques and tools are available that address these challenges, often application scientists are not aware of these tools, aren't familiar with the tools' use, or the tools are not installed at the appropriate facilities."

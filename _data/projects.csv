BIDS Collaborative Projects,BIDS Collaborative Projects,Undergraduate,Industry,http://datasci.berkeley.edu,"Graduate and undergraduate students experience a great disconnect between academic work and real-world impact. Much of their skills and experience are not applied to real-world problems during their time in Berkeley. At the same time, many organizations on and off campus have limited bandwidth to solve their complex data science challenges. BIDS Collaborative will solve this disconnect between student demand for projects with real-world impact and institutions that lack the resources to recruit data scientists. \n\n BIDS Collaborative will facilitate the creation of four-student interdisciplinary teams to work on semester- and year-long real-world projects. Working with faculty, we will also provide students with academic credit and training opportunities. BIDS Collaborative hopes to develop innovative data science solutions to challenges in academia, government, non-profits, and industry while also creating a pipeline of students for successful future careers in data science.

Data Science Society at Berkeley Research Projects,Data Science Society at Berkeley Research Projects,Undergraduate,Research,http://dssberkeley.org/projects.html,DSSB provides members with substantial opportunites to collaborate. We host group study sessions for data science courses. We partner undergraduate students with graduate student researchers on ongoing data science projects.
Data Science Society at Berkeley Industry Projects,Data Science Society at Berkeley Industry Projects,Undergraduate,Industry,http://dssberkeley.org/projects.html,"DSSB encourages innovation through our in-house data science projects, competitions, and discussions on recent data science news. Members can initiate their own data science project and find partners through the club."
Machine Learning at Berkeley Industry Projects,Machine Learning at Berkeley Industry Projects (ML@B|C),Undergraduate,Industry,http://ml.berkeley.edu,"ML@B aims to empower passionate students to solve real world data-driven  problems through collaboration with companies and internal research. \n\n ML@B will be hosting public events throughout the semester including tech talks, guest lectures, workshops, and research mixers. They are also launching two pilot programs --- research division, ML@B|X and our consulting operations, ML@B|C. Selected students will be paired with teams where they can work on projects ranging from predicting consumer trends to building computing clusters."

Digital Humanities at Berkeley Projects,Digital Humanities at Berkeley Projects,Graduate,Research,http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/projects,"The DH project directory is a listing of digital humanities work at Berkeley. Project pages are good for raising the visibility of your work and connecting to collaborators, both on- and off-campus. Anyone with a UC Berkeley affiliation can submit a project. After submitting an initial (brief) application for a project page, project owners will be able to edit and update their project information via the DH at Berkeley at website. Projects that are complete or are no longer affiliated with UC Berkeley will be archived at the end of each semester."
Undergraduate Statistics Association Research Projects,Undergraduate Statistics Association Research Projects,Undergraduate,Research,http://www.usaberkeley.org/#!project/vhvnv,"The Undergraduate Statistics Association is a premier organization at UC Berkeley that stimulates its members' interests in Statistics and facilitates their further development in a statistics career. Each semester we work on a diverse slate of projects. From analyzing city traffic data to surveying Cal Undergraduates, our members become experienced data collectors, data mungers, data modelers, data visualizers, and data presenters. We bring skill sets from academia and the workforce to tackle any kind of challenge. More importantly, we come together as a team to learn from each other and collaborate together."

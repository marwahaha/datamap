Python Bootcamp at LBL,Python Bootcamp at LBL,Graduate,Numerical,Workshops,https://sites.google.com/site/pythonbootcamp/,"The purpose of the boot camp is to get those familiar with other computing languages (like C, Java, FORTRAN, and Lisp) ramped on the basics of the Python language. This is not a computer science class; understanding of basic CS concepts (like looping, recursion, pointers, etc.) are presupposed. The boot camp itself is a mixture of formal lectures, in-class demos, coding breakout sessions for participants, and homework projects. The Camp runs from 8:30am to 5pm each day and is open to anyone within the UC Berkeley and LBNL community.  A small fee to offset the costs will be collected at the time of official registration. There will be a limited number of slots open to industry participants. "
DS421 Training,DS421 Training,Graduate,Social Science,Workshops,http://bids.berkeley.edu/research/environment-and-society-data-sciences-21st-century-ds421,"Environment and Society, Data Science for the 21st Century (DS421) is a new National Science Foundation Research Traineeship interdisciplinary graduate training program at UC Berkeley at the interface of data, social, and natural sciences. Environmental change is accelerating, driven by growth in population and consumption and the inexorable impact of CO2 emissions on global climate. At the same time, advances in technology are generating an explosive flood of data, fueling the emerging field of data science and the need for all researchers and educators to become fluent with new concepts and tools that are driving discovery. The DS421 program will train a new generation of scientists to tackle grand challenges at the intersection of natural, social, and data sciences, translating data into evidence-based analysis of impacts and solutions in the face of rapid environmental change."

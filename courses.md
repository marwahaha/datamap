title: Courses

Ideas for this page:

* a list of different data science courses
* a course map of data science courses, analogous to efforts by [HKN](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/courseguides)
* a course guide with a brief summary of each data science course
* a decision tree ("if I'm interested in this and I've taken this class, what should I take next?")
* datascience related [course list, maintained by D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/course-list){:target="_blank"}
* datascience related [campus labs and departments, maintained by BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu/resources/labs-and-departments){:target="_blank"}
* datascience related [campus resources, maintained by D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/dlab-campus-resources)

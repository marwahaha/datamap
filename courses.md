### Data Science-Related Courses at UC Berkeley

These are semester-long computational courses (in some academic domain) or data-intensive courses at UC Berkeley. If you have suggestions or things to add, please [email](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu).


* Data Science related [Course List, maintained by D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/course-list){:target="_blank"}
* Data 8: [List of connector courses](http://databears.berkeley.edu/sp16){:target="_blank"}
* Khoa's [Data Science at Berkeley Guide](http://kqdtran.github.io/so-i-heard-youre-an-aspiring-golden-bear-data-scient-ish/)


### Ideas for Improvement:

* a course map of data science courses, analogous to efforts by [HKN](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/courseguides)
* a course guide with a brief summary of each data science course
* a decision tree ("if I'm interested in this and I've taken this class, what should I take next?")

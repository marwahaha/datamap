* Data Science-related [course list, maintained by D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/course-list){:target="_blank"}
* [Data 8 and connector courses](http://databears.berkeley.edu/sp16){:target="_blank"}



#### Ideas for improvement:

* a list of different data science courses
* a course map of data science courses, analogous to efforts by [HKN](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/courseguides)
* a course guide with a brief summary of each data science course
* a decision tree ("if I'm interested in this and I've taken this class, what should I take next?")

title: Courses

Ideas for this page include:

* a list of different data science courses
* a course map of data science courses, analogous to efforts by [HKN](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/courseguides)
* a course guide with a brief summary of each data science course
* a decision tree ("if I'm interested in this and I've taken this class, what should I take next?")

If you have suggestions or things to add, please [email](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu).

description: CDIPS is a graduate student run organization that provides resources to graduate students and postdocs in the physical and mathematical sciences about their options outside academia through a speaker series, the Data Science Workshop, and improved access to alumni.  Founded in 2012, CDIPS aims to provide scientists with the information they need to make better informed career decisions. The Data Science Workshop is a three-week program in late July where small teams of graduate students are paired with mentors from industry to complete an outstanding problem in data science. It was developed to address an issue that was highlighted by a number of our guests from the Speaker Series: 'The gap between academic science and industry is often narrow but deep. Many of the skills you may lack are seen as necessary by an employer, but can be easily learned.'

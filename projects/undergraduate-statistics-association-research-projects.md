description: The Undergraduate Statistics Association is a premier organization at UC Berkeley that stimulates its members' interests in Statistics and facilitates their further development in a statistics career. Each semester we work on a diverse slate of projects. From analyzing city traffic data to surveying Cal Undergraduates, our members become experienced data collectors, data mungers, data modelers, data visualizers, and data presenters. We bring skill sets from academia and the workforce to tackle any kind of challenge. More importantly, we come together as a team to learn from each other and collaborate together.

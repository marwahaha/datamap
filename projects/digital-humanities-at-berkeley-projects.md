description: The DH project directory is a listing of digital humanities work at Berkeley. Project pages are good for raising the visibility of your work and connecting to collaborators, both on- and off-campus. Anyone with a UC Berkeley affiliation can submit a project. After submitting an initial (brief) application for a project page, project owners will be able to edit and update their project information via the DH at Berkeley at website. Projects that are complete or are no longer affiliated with UC Berkeley will be archived at the end of each semester.

description: The SciDAC SDAV Institute will actively work with application teams to assist them in achieving breakthrough science and will provide technical solutions in the data management, analysis, and visualization regimes that are broadly applicable in the computational science community. As the scale of computation has exploded, the data produced by these simulations has increased in size, complexity, and richness by orders of magnitude, and this trend will continue. Users of scientific computing systems are faced with the daunting task of managing and analyzing their datasets for knowledge discovery, frequently using antiquated tools more appropriate for the teraflop era. While new techniques and tools are available that address these challenges, often application scientists are not aware of these tools, aren't familiar with the tools' use, or the tools are not installed at the appropriate facilities.

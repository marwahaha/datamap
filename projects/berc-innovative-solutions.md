description: BERC Innovative Solutions (BIS) is an energy and resources-focused consulting program led by students from across UC Berkeley’s top graduate departments. The program’s evolution has been driven by demand from both students and organizations in business, nonprofit and government. BIS is dedicated to working with clients to address their strategic energy and resources opportunities and challenges, while providing talented students with experiential learning through meaningful projects. The BIS application process matches balanced teams with complementary areas of academic focus and past professional experience with the skill sets needed to meet each client’s needs. Collaborating across academic disciplines provides both unique opportunities for student participants and rich perspectives for BIS clients.

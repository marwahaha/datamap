description: This course capitalizes on a successful approach of using definitional formulas to emphasize concepts of statistics, rather than rote memorization in both qualitative and quantitative anthropology. This conceptual approach constantly reminds the students of the logic behind what they are learning. Procedures are taught verbally, numerically, and visually, to reach students with different learning styles.

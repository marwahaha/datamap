description: An introduction to the basic approaches and techniques in archaeobotanical analysis. A series of different data types and their unique approaches will be discussed, including phytoliths, pollen, and DNA, with an emphasis on macrofloral remains. Laboratory study will include the major classes of plant remains likely to be encountered in archaeological sites. Discussion will emphasize the use of plant remains to answer archaeological questions, rather than study the plant remains for their own sake. Microscope work and computing will be included.

description: How does the human mind work? We explore this question by analyzing a range of data concerning such topics as human rationality and irrationality, human memory, how objects and events are represented in the mind, and the relation of language and cognition. This class provides young scientists with critical thinking and computing skills that will allow them to work with data in cognitive science and related disciplines.

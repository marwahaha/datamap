description: Introduces concepts of computational modeling and simulation, using multidisciplinary projects drawn from biology, chemistry, applied mathematics, and physics, and all areas of engineering. Models progress sequentially through problem statement, mathematical model, approximations and analytic solution, discrete model, object-oriented model, implementation and simulation, visualization, comparison to analysis, experiment and observation. Includes a broad survey of simulation techniques.

units: 3
tools: nan
description: Introducing the use of bioinformatics tools useful in linking the molecular structure of chemicals to the toxicity they induce in biological systems. Discussions on the highly interactive process of collecting, organizing, and assimilating chemistry and toxicology information - and the use of computer programs to visualize, browse, and interpret this information to discover chemical structure-toxicity correlations. The importance of these concepts in drug discovery and development and food safety will be emphasized.

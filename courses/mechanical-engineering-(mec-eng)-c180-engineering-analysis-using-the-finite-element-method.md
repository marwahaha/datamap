description: This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism.

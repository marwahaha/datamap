description: This course offers an introduction to spatial data analysis. It integrates ArcGIS analysis with spatial statistical analysis for the study of pattern and process applicable to a wide variety of fields. Major topics covered include - spatial sampling, processing data with ARC Info, exploratory GIS analysis, spatial decomposition, spatial point patterns and Ripley's K function, spatial autocorrelation, geostatistics, spatially weighted regression, spatial autoregression, generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models. accompany the formation of multicultural Europe. This involves (1) an examination of the traditional concepts of nationhood and citizenship, and (2)a study of the Europeanization of culture. Also listed as History C176 and Geography C152.

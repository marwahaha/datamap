description: This course uses simulation models for analyzing and optimizing systems where the underlying processes and/or parameters are not fully known, but data may be available, sampled, or artificially generated. Monte Carlo simulations are used in a weekly laboratory to model systems that may be too complex to approximate accurately with deterministic, stationary, or static models; and to measure the robustness of predictions and manage risks in decisions based on data-driven models.

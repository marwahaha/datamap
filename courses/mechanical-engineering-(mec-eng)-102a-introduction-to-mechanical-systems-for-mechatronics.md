description: The objectives of this course are to introduce students to modern experimental techniques for mechanical engineering, and to improve students' written and oral communication skills. Students will be provided exposure to, and experience with, a variety of sensors used in mechatronic systems including sensors to measure temperature, displacement, velocity, acceleration and strain. The role of error and uncertainty in measurements and analysis will be examined. Students will also be provided exposure to, and experience with, using commercial software for data acquisition and analysis. The role and limitations of spectral analysis of digital data will be discussed.

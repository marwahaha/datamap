description: Introduction to computer science in the context of data science. This course provides a formal and rigorous introduction to the programming topics that appear in Foundations of Data Science, expands the repertoire of computational concepts, and exposes students to techniques of abstraction at several levels, including layers of software and machines from a programmerså¥¨__ point of view. It provides an understanding of the structures that underlie the programs, algorithms, and languages used in data science and other settings. It focuses on paradigms for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, and declarative programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a valuable side effect of studying these general techniques. It provides practical experience with composing larger computational systems through several significant programming projects. Students coming out of this course will be prepared to develop substantial applications and for further studies in Computer Science, including CS61B. Treatment is CS is designed for a wide range of interests.

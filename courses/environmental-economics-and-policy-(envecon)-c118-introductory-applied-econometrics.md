description: Advanced cartographic methods will focus primarily on data acquisition, manipulation, analysis, and representation using GIS software and vector-based illustration software, in the service of geographical analysis. Given that recording the geolocation of scientific, business and social data is now routine, the question of what we can learn from the spatial aspect of data arises. This class looks at challenges in analyzing spatial data, particularly scale and spatial dependence. Various methods are considered such as hotspot detection, interpolation, and map overlay. The emphasis throughout is hands on and practical rather than theoretical.

title: Engineering (ENGIN) 180A Computational Engineering Science Modeling and Simulation I/II
units: 4
tools: nan
description: This course sequence focuses on the concepts of computational modeling and simulation. Concepts are illustrated with projects drawn from the multidisciplinary areas of computational engineering science. Areas covered span biology, chemistry, applied mathematics, and physics, as well as all areas of engineering. Models will progress sequentially through problem statement, mathematical model, approximations and analytic solution, discrete model, object-oriented model, implementation and simulation, visualization, and comparison to analysis, experimentation and observation.

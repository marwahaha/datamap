course-name: Computational Models of Cognition
prerequisites: MATH 1A, MATH 1B, CS 70 or MATH 55, COG SCI 1, CS 61A
description: This course will provide advanced students in cognitive science and computer science with the skills to develop computational models of human cognition, giving insight into how people solve challenging computational problems, as well as how to bring computers closer to human performance. The course will explore three ways in which researchers have attempted to formalize cognition -- symbolic approaches, neural networks, and probability and statistics -- considering the strengths and weaknesses of each.

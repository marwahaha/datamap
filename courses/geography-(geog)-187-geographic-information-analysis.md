description: This course will cover topics related to the interplay between optimization and statistical learning. The first part of the course will cover statistical modeling procedures that can be defined as the minimizer of a suitable optimization problem. The second part of the course will discuss the formulation and numerical implementation of learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC), which is a method for robust adaptive optimization that can use machine learning to provide the adaptation. The last part of the course will deal with inverse decision-making problems, which are problems where an agent's decisions are observed and used to infer properties about the agent.

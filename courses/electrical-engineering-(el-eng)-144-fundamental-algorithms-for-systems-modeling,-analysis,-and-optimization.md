title: Electrical Engineering (EL ENG) 144 Fundamental Algorithms for Systems Modeling, Analysis, and Optimization
units: 4
tools: R, Python
description: The modeling, analysis, and optimization of complex systems requires a range of algorithms and design software. This course reviews the fundamental techniques underlying the design methodology for complex systems, using integrated circuit design as example. Topics include design flows, discrete and continuous models and algorithms, and strategies for implementing algorithms efficiently and correctly in software. Laboratory assignments and a class project will expose students to state-of-the-art tools.
